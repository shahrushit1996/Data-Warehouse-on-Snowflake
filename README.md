The repository includes details & conveys the journey of creating a Data Warehouse solution for sample retail stores. 

The project requires building a data warehouse to analyze current store performance, resulting in insights and trends that can be used to make recommendations for enhancing store productivity and assisst in organizational business expansion.

The project is developed using Snowflake and Tableau with SQL being the core programming language.

THE JOURNEY

Step 1: load the raw data into a staging layer.

Step 2: Draft an ERD for dimensional data warehouse, i.e., creating fact and dimension tables and building the relationship between them through primary key-foreign key pairs.

Step 3: Transform the data using SQL on Snowflake and load these tables.

Step 4: Create views on top of these tables using SQL to answer the questions mentioned below.

Step 5: Build visualizations using the views in Tableau to narrate the data story and recommend solution based on the insights.

Questions:

An overall assessment of Stores.

How are they performing compared to target? Will they meet their 2014 target?

Should either store be closed? Why or why not?

What should be done in the next year to maximize store profits?

Recommend 2013 bonus amounts for each store if the total bonus pool is $2,000,000 using a comparison of 2013 actual sales vs. 2013 sales targets as the basis for the recommendation.

Assess product sales by day of the week. What can we learn about sales trends?

Should any new stores be opened? Include all stores in your analysis if necessary. If so, where? Why or why not?

Based on the insights and trends identified via the tableau visualizations, recommendations were made to improve performkance and make business decisions.
